# Minutes of the 33rd meeting of the Scala Center, Q3 2024

Minutes are [archived](https://scala.epfl.ch/records.html) on the
Scala Center website.

## Summary

The following agenda was distributed to attendees:
[agenda](TODO).

The meeting took place towards the end of Q3, so we considered it to
be a combined meeting (with a combined report) covering both Q2 and
Q3.

(TODO any board changes?)

(TODO staffing changes?)

Center activities for the past two quarters focused on TODO

Details are below and in the Center's activity report:

* [report](https://scala.epfl.ch/records/2024-Q2-Q3-activity-report.html)

Two new proposals were received:

* [SCP-032](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/main/proposals/032-scala-version-guidance.md): Provide guidance on choosing between Scala LTS and Next
* [SCP-033](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/main/proposals/033-deprecate-scala-ide.md): Deprecate Eclipse Scala IDE

Both proposals were accepted by the board (and both were later
completed, in October).
