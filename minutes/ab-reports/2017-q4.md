## Scalameta

**Ólafur Páll Geirsson [@olafurpg]**

Released Scalameta v2.1.2, see [changelog](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
Highlights:
- [#1143] Fix incompatibility with the semanticdb-scalac compiler plugin
  and scalamacros/paradise macro annotation.
- [#1144] Upgrade semanticdb-scalac to 2.12.4. Due to large internal refactorings
  in scalac typer, this upgrade turned out to be unusually complicated.
- [#1145] Fix bug in handling of by-name and repeated parameters.
- [#1148] Add `Denotation.members`. This opens the possibility to reproduce
  lexical scoping at a position enabling rules like 1) `ExplicitResultTypes`
  to safely insert unqualified named with accompanying imports or 2) an
  `OrganizeImports` rule to safely.
- [#1154] Fix bug where `Foo` in `new Foo {}` resolved to an anonymous class
  instead of the `Foo` symbol.
- [#1158] Amongst many things, significantly reduces memory pressure while compiling
  sources with the semanticdb-scalac compiler plugin, which is required by Scalafix.

## Scalafix

**Ólafur Páll Geirsson [@olafurpg]** and **Guillaume Massé [@MasseGuillaume]**

Guillaume joins Ólafur on the Scalafix project. He will work on a wide range of topics, including adding new rules and polish the general user experience, which is quite rough at the moment.

Released Scalafix v0.5.6, see [changelog](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix/releases/tag/v0.5.6).

Highlights:
- [#412] Make it easy to enable sbt-scalafix for custom configurations like
  IntegrationTest. ([@olafurpg])
- [#415] Suppress false linter errors with comments. This PR makes
  it practical to use Scalafix for linting, since previously there was no way
  to silence Scalafix for exceptional cases where the linter reports a bogus
  diagnostic. ([@olafurpg], [@MasseGuillaume])
- [#418] Added detailed documentation comparing scalafix with alternative tools
  like Scala Refactoring, WartRemover, ScalaStyle and IntelliJ Scala plugin. ([@olafurpg]
- [#419] Simplify installation of sbt-scalafix. Based on feedback from users,
  this PR adds a `scalafixEnable` command that can automatically setup all the
  correct scala compiler settings from an sbt shell session, regardless of
  existing settings in build.sbt. Previously, it was necessary to manually
  update build.sbt with fairly tricky corner cases. ([@olafurpg])
- [#420] Reviewed PR adding documentation for how to use scalafix for Maven builds. ([@olafurpg])
- [#431] Implement a Syntaxtic rule to disable Scala keyword, xml, tabs, carriage return and semicolons ([@MasseGuillaume])
- [#454] Refactor the sbt build to improve release cycle.
- [#465] Add --diff option to only run scalafix on a set of changes pending code review. This should makes it easy to incrementally incorporate scalafix rules into an existing large codebase.

## Macros

**Ólafur Páll Geirsson [@olafurpg]**

- Wrote ["What's happening with macros?"](http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/11/27/macros.html)
  blog post.
- A lot of failed experiments trying to automatically expanded trees from
  scala-reflect macros that that mix untyped and typed trees.
- Studying @odersky's ideas about a new design for macros that unifies LMS
  and macros, see [discussion](https://gist.github.com/odersky/f91362f6d9c58cc1db53f3f443311140#gistcomment-2242950)
- Orienting Ryan Culpepper, the author of Racket macros, on the design challenges in this new macro rework. Ryan has expressed interest in contributing to this project.
- Leaning about [Squid](https://github.com/epfldata/squid/), a
  metaprogramming framework based on type-safe and hygienic quasiquotes,
  developed at the DATA lab at EPFL.
  Squid seems to address a lot of issues in scala-reflect and may be a great
  complement to the new macros.
  Squid also builds on top of scala-reflect, which means it could maybe provide
  a smooth migration story for the existing ecosystem of macros.


## Compiler Profiling
[(SCP-010)](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/010-compiler-profiling.md)

**Jorge Vicente Cantero [@jvican]**

`scalac-profiling` has been significantly improved to be battle-tested in big,
well-known open source libraries of the Scala community. This work started as
part of my writing of a technical guide to let people in the Scala community
use the plugin to profile their projects. This technical guide will be
published towards the beginning of December.

Improvements to the project:

- Add flamegraph generation for implicit searches (!).
- Add dot graph generation for implicit searches.
- [Add more measurements of the compiler to get more data for
  users](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalac-profiling/pull/13).
- Profile the cost of macros and implicit search in all the integration builds.
- Add `shapeless`, `scalatest`, `better-files` and `scalac` as [new integration
  builds](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalac-profiling/pull/15) of the
  `scalac-profiling` build (complementing our previous integration builds
  `circe` and `monocle`). Every merge in the project is tested against these
  projects in the CI to ensure there's bad interaction.

For a sneak preview, [head to this page][scalac-profiling-docs] that explains
the current status of the visualizations of implicit search. If you're too
busy, check [the Flamegraph][flamegraph] and [dot graph][] for the [example in
the Circe website][circe website].

The plan for the technical guide is the following:

* Explain the overall idea of `scalac-profiling` and why it allows people to
  fix their compile times.
* Write the guide by showing how to profile compile times for several use
  cases. Every use case will be for some of the integration builds that we
  have: shapeless, scalatest, and circe.


## Zinc

**Jorge Vicente Cantero [@jvican]**

([Read the blog article](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/11/03/zinc-blog-1.0.html))

My work on Zinc has focused on several areas:

- [Improving classpath hashing for incremental
   compilations](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/452). The classpath hashing
   was added before the Scala Center got involved in the project and created
   a severe regression in incremental compiles for users of Zinc 1.0 --
   incremental compiles were much slower because it had to hash all the
   classpath entries. This regression was measured to be in the range of 15 to
   40 seconds in medium to big projects.
- [Fix #127: Use unexpanded names](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/431).
- Reviewed around 8 PRs on our queue; some have been merged, some are still
   under work.
- [Fix #436: Remove annoying log4j scripted exception](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/441).
- Work on a better build and test workflow for Zinc. The scripted integration
   was slow, and that put off contributions and made changes to Zinc slow to
   happen. The rework of the build is split into several PRs ([#438][#438],
   [#428][#428], [#429][#429] and [#440][#440]) that add:
   - A Zinc scripted mechanism that is reproducible (isolated from users'
      cache) and fast (parallel execution of tests). Note that Zinc uses an
      independent scripted than sbt.
   - On-merge releases (so that users of Zinc can depend on versions of pull
      requests that have been merged right away instead of being blocked on
      maintainers to release them).
   - A `publishLocal` implementation that is cached and avoids publishing when
      the same version is already in the cache.
   - Better UI for both the build and the test execution (colors,
      highlighting, log collection in an independent tmp folder, etc).
   - Documentation for all the steps of the build and removal of dead code.


## Scala Platform

**Jorge Vicente Cantero [@jvican]**

- Installed the new Drone CI version (`0.8`) in
   `platform.scala-lang.org` for the benefit of the Scala Platform maintainers
   and the Scala Center engineers.
- Coordinated two pull requests for Scala JSON and Better files that
   use the new Scala Platform infrastructure.
- Made [several significant improvements][sbt-platform-improvements] to
   the [Scala Platform plugin][sbt-platform], which now fully integrates with
   the `sbt-release-early` and has a detailed test infrastructure.
- Had the second SPP meeting with all the Committee members. These are the
   outcomes of the meeting:
   - Introduction of the roadmap for the Scala Platform.
   - Initial explanation of how the Scala standard library split will happen.
   - `better-files` got approved to be added to the platform by unanimity.
   - first steps discussing whether the Scala Platform modules should support
     cross-platform.


## Community

**Darja Jovanovic [@darjutak]**

Started at the Scala Center as an intern on October 24th, 2017.

**Role:** Communication manager.

- Make sure the SIP/SPP meetings are organized on a monthly bases, minutes
published in a timely manner and communication distributed throughout the
Scala channels. **Goal:** Both with a goal of developing trust, gaining
momentum, deciding about different proposals and moving forward.
- Gather and publish Scala Center monthly updates to community
and AB alike.

**Results so far:**

Big increase in the number of people who tune into SIP meetings:

![2017-q4/youtube_view_overview.png](2017-q4/youtube_view_overview.png)

Big uptick in views on Scala Contributors posts announcing what the SC has
been up to.

- Sept-Oct updates, 792 views:

### Stickers

Community engagement exercise with **incredible** outcome!

- Decided to give away Scala and Scala Center stickers.
- After a single tweet about it, **we got 891 responses with an amazing comments full of love and appreciation
for Scala!** [Here are those responses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-1Xh9KgTq35sviVYOVfzzqA7X4NYxwioBtfhWzwXZYw/edit?usp=sharing)
- Sending out stickers to users weekly; 200 letters in each batch to every corner of the world!

## Scala Improvement Process

**Jorge Vicente Cantero [@jvican]**

- The SIP meeting scheduled to happen on the 29th December was cancelled
   because we didn't reach the quorum. Darja is working on the reschedule.
- Create first prototype for [`opaque
   type`s](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/opaque-types.html). The pull request
   will be made before our next SIP meeting.
- Coordination with the Committee on several topics.
- Organisation of a voting in the next SIP meeting to vote for the admission
   of a Typelevel representative: Miles Sabin.
- Synchronization with Miles on several proposals he's preparing.

## Scala Days PC Organization

**Darja Jovanovic [@darjutak]**

Scala Center's goal: assist in pulling in as much of the community to the Scala
Days events as possible. We'd like to see more community talks this year.

  - Martin Odersky
  - Lars Hupel
  - Adriaan Moors
  - Manuel Bernhardt
  - Heather Miller
  - Markus Eisele
  - Josh Suereth
- Already ~40 talk proposals submitted!

## SBT 1.x Plugin Migration

As part of SCP-013, we migrated two of the most starred open source sbt plugins that had not been
ported to sbt 1.0 yet:

**Guillaume Massé [@MasseGuillaume]** and **Martin Duhem [@Duhemm]**

Based on the [sbt 1.x migration wiki](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/wiki/sbt-1.x-plugin-migration). We
migrated non-commercial plugins that have an impact on the community:

* [scala-native](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native) is a new target for the Scala programming
  language. It uses llvm to link an run Scala code to any platform. It has a seamless integration with sbt. You
  can run and test just like you do it on the JVM. [PR #1039](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/pull/1039) ([@MasseGuillaume])

* Dotty is a research platform for new language concepts and compiler technologies for Scala. It's tightly
  coupled with sbt and Zinc and the migration to 1.X is still in progress. There is more detail on the [Dotty](#dotty)
  section ([@Duhemm])

* [sbt-dependency-graph](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph) is a tool to understand how your
  external dependencies are wired together. It's essential to debug anomalies on the classpath. [PR #140](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/pull/140) [PR #139](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/pull/139) ([@MasseGuillaume])

* [g8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8) in an sbt plugin that powers the `sbt new` command. It allows
  the creation of template to quickly create new projects. [PR #350](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/pull/350) ([@MasseGuillaume])

* [sbt-aws-lambda](https://github.com/gilt/sbt-aws-lambda) is an sbt plugin that helps developer in
  deploying code to AWS lambda. [PR #39](https://github.com/gilt/sbt-aws-lambda/pull/39) ([@Duhemm])

* [sbt-spark-submit](https://github.com/saurfang/sbt-spark-submit) is an sbt plugin that makes it
  easy to submit jobs to spark, using spark-submit under the hood.
  [PR #9](https://github.com/saurfang/sbt-spark-submit/pull/9). ([@Duhemm])

Thanks to the authors of these plugins for the quick reviews!

As far as we can tell, most of the open source, non-commercially owned sbt plugin now support sbt
1.0. Please let us know if we missed something important!

## Dotty

**Martin Duhem [@Duhemm]**

### Specializing functions

The work I started last month (from
[an initial PR by Felix Mulder](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/1807)) to specialize
functions in the dotc compiler is working. Our tests show that the code that is produced by dotty
allocates fewer boxes to hold primitive values. However, it turns out that it [has a negative impact
on the performance of the compiler](http://dotty-bench.epfl.ch/) and increases compilation
time.

I am working on reducing the overhead of this optimization so that compilation times are not
affected.

The work is happening on [this pull request](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/3306).


### Embedding documentation in TASTY

I started working on embedding documentation in TASTY, so that it is always available with the
classfiles of a compiled project. The goal is to be able to easily query the documentation from the
REPL, or an IDE:

```
scala> object Foo { /** hello! */ def bar = 123 }
scala> object Random {
     |   /** Returns a random number
     |    *  @return A number chosen by fair dice roll,
     |    *          guaranteed to be random.
     |    */
     |   def getRandomNumber(): Int = 4
     | }
defined object Random

scala> :? Random.getRandomNumber
/** Returns a random number
 *  @return A number chosen by fair dice roll,
 *          guaranteed to be random.
 */
def getRandomNumber(): Int
```

At the moment, my work in progress can store the documentation strings in a new section of
the TASTY information and the REPL starts to support queries but needs more work.


### Improving the Dotty Community Build

The [Dotty Community Build](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-community-build) is a corpus of open
source Scala projects that we use to detect regression in Dotty. At the time of writing, eight projects
are part of the Dotty Community Build.

Every night, we use the latest nightly release of Dotty to compile those eight projects, and can
therefore quickly detect any regression. However, we didn't have a simple way to test the Dotty
community build against a pull request, a tag or a specific commit.

I took some time to improve on that and added a new script that allows us, given a reference inside
[the Dotty repository](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty), to locally build, publish and test Dotty
against the community build. This way, we can merge with confidence pull requests that may cause a
regression that would be hard to catch with smaller tests.

[Here is the pull request.](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-community-build/pull/24)

We do not have integration with our bot at the moment, be I hope to add that soon.


### Porting Dotty to sbt 1

The dotty sbt plugin can currently only be used with sbt 0.13. However, now that sbt 1.0 is out, it
makes sense to upgrade to the latest versions of sbt. Future releases of Dotty will drop support for
sbt 0.13.

[I started upgrading our build, plugin and compiler
interface](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/3441) to sbt 1.0 and the latest release of
Zinc. Upgrading to the latest version of sbt lets us benefit from the recent improvements that were
made in sbt, and most notably it allows us to enjoy faster incremental builds, thanks to the new
class based name hashing featured in Zinc 1.0.

Because of the many changes that happened in Zinc, especially regarding how a Scala compiler must
communicate API and dependency analyses with the incremental compiler, upgrading our compiler
interface was a large task. We also discovered several bugs in Zinc in that process.

After I got our build to work and all our tests to pass, I needed to upgrade all the projects that
appear in our community build to use sbt 1.0. The changes that were made to upgrade the build
definitions to sbt 1.0 have been proposed for inclusion the upstream projects, and I am waiting to
hear back from them.

The work is happening on [this pull request](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/3441).


### Fixing two bugs in generic java signatures

My first task with Dotty was to add [support for generic java
signatures](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/3234). See my description in [our previous Scala
Center
update](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-center-project-updates-mid-sept-to-mid-oct/1232)
to know what this work is all about.

We [discovered a bug with the generic signatures](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/3411),
where additional parameter lists may be missing.

I [fixed this issue in a subsequent pull request](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/3414).

Another bug was discovered, regarding [singleton types and their
signatures](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/3553). I worked on [a fix for this
issue](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/3563). The patch was merged and released in Dotty
0.5.0-RC1.

## MOOCs

**Julien Richard-Foy [@julienrf]**

Added XQueue support to our grading infrastructure. I implemented an XQueue client that periodically polls the queue for
assignments to grade, and launch the corresponding grader each time there is a new assignment to grade.

## Scala.js Bundler


[(SCP-005)](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/005-continuity-of-scala-js.md)
-------------------------

**Julien Richard-Foy [@julienrf]**

- Made it possible to release scalajs-bundler by pushing a Git tag [#184](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler/pull/184), so that any contributor that has write access to the
  scalajs-bundler GitHub repository can cut a release (they don’t need to deal with Sonatype
  access rights)
- Released [scalajs-bundler 0.9.0](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler/changelog.html#version-0.9.0)

## Collections

[(SCP-007)](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/007-collections.md)

**Julien Richard-Foy [@julienrf]**

- Fixed undefined references in API documentation [#274](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/274)
- Ported scalacheck tests of the current collections to the strawman [#276](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/276)
- Reviewed @marcelocenerine’s work on `lazyZip`. The goal of this operation is to provide
  a more discoverable alternative to `(xs, ys).zipped`. The new syntax is `xs lazyZip ys`.
  This operation lazily zips collections together (the zipped collection is not evaluated
  unless it is iterated on) and provides transformation operations (such as `map` and
  `filter`) that don’t create intermediate tuples. [#223](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/223)
- Tried an alternative approach to implement `MultiMap`: create its branch in the
  hierarchy. [#269](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/269)
- Fixed performance regressions [#270](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/270),
  [#271](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/271).
- Added an `updateWith`/`updatedWith` operation to `Map` collection types (in collections-contrib)
  [#268](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/268).
- Merged `foldSomeLeft` and `lazyFoldRight` operations [#295](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/295).
- Added `MultiSet` and `SortedMultiSet` [#299](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/299). This addition
  is only available in the `collections-contrib` artifact. These new collections form a new branch (they are not
  comparable with `Set`).
- Reviewed and merged `minAfter` and `maxBefore` operations on sorted collections [#302](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/302).
- Overrode a bunch of methods in strict collections, for performance [#305](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/305).


## Collaboration: Introducing Bloop, a wrapper around Zinc
**Martin Duhem [@Duhemm](https://github.com/Duhemm)** and **Jorge Vicente Cantero [@jvican](https://github.com/jvican)**

[Bloop](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop) is a command-line tool for fast edit/compile/test
workflows. Its primary goal is to give you the fastest possible experience specifically in the
edit/compile/test loop. Bloop is not meant to replace your current build system. The name stands
for “build loop”.

For more details about Bloop, see our recently released blog post: [Meet Bloop, a fast tool to
compile and test your project](http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/11/30/bloop-release.html)

### Analysis of Scalac performance

We created `bloop` because we observed that Scala compile times slow down when
within sbt when compared to isolated benchmarks. This observation was at the
beginning just an intuition, but when we sat down to measure a prototype we did
see a significant difference.

| Project name      | sbt (version) | bloop | speedup |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------- |
| sbt/sbt           | 21s (1.0.4)   | 15s   | 1.17    |
| guardian/frontend | 37s (0.13.16) | 28s   | 1.32    |
| apache/spark      | 159s (0.13.16)| 107s  | 1.4     |
| scala/scala       | 65s (0.13.16) | 50s   | 1.14    |

These numbers have been obtained on an isolated machine, measuring at the fifth hot clean-compile
iteration (of all the projects and subprojects of the build without counting the tests) and with 2
gigabytes of heap for both sbt and bloop (the shell, not the nailgun
integration). When benchmarking sbt, we have made sure that dependency
resolution and formatting are not measured.

Note that in practice, the provided speedup is higher because sbt's
inherent model runs all the dependent tasks on compile every time people do
`compile`, `~compile`, `test` or `~test`. This cost is "constant", but it's not
negligible for big codebases and although we don't add it in our analysis,
we're confident that bloop outperforms sbt's Scala compilation by wider margins
that the ones here reported.

Note also that we have not taken into account the fact that Zinc 1.0 (the incremental
compiler that Bloop uses is much more precise and takes more time than the
Zinc 0.13.16). 2-3% can probably be gained in favor of Bloop in those previous
benchmarks.
