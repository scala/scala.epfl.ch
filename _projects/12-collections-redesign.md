description: "The Scala collections library underwent a major redesign in Scala 2.8."
---
The Scala collections library underwent a major redesign in Scala 2.8. While the current design proved to be successful in many areas, several pain points have become apparent over the years which indicate fundamental issues with the design that cannot be removed through gradual minor changes. This prompted the request for strawman proposals for a new design in the context of Dotty. We propose that the Scala Center work on the implementation of this new design for the Scala 2.13 standard library.
    The work in progress can be seen in the following github repository: [https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman)
