The Scala Platform Process provides organizational support for a broad range of open source software projects. The mission of the process is to provide high-quality software for the good of the Scala community. Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process, the Platform delivers a stable collection of libraries with widespread use and a low barrier entry for beginners and intermediate users, ready for serious production use.

You can find more information on the Scala Platform [here](https://platform.scala-lang.org). If you would like to get involved into OSS development of the Scala Platform, let us know over [Gitter](https://gitter.im/scala/contributors).
