description: The Scala Center is responsible for many online courses that introduce the multiple styles of programming in Scala.

Our mission is to develop quality and widely accessible educational materials,
and to make them freely available. We have launched 6 courses along with a
capstone project. All the courses deliver a certificate of completion, or they
can be taken for free.

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
- [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2)
- [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1)
- [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data)
- [Functional Programming in Scala Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone).
- [Programming Reactive Systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-akka-reactive)
- [Effective Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/effective-scala)

The courses use Scala 3, but you can still take the Scala 2 version of the courses here:

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-functional-programming)
- [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-functional-program-design)
- [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-parallel-programming)
- [Programming Reactive Systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-akka-reactive) (also available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-reactive-systems-3))

We have also created a [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/scala_tutorial/terms_and_types)
interactive tutorial that is based off of our above MOOCs. Walk through the
material of the functional programming in Scala MOOCs as an interactive
tutorial!
