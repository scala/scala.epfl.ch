    The Scala Center invites anyone interested in programming languages and open source to join us once a month for a lunch break. Participants get to hear from colleagues about their ongoing work and share their own stories. It’s a great opportunity to network amongst PL enthusiasts, share your passion and get some valuable input. And yes, we will speak about Scala too. :) You can expect the <a href="https://scala.epfl.ch/team.html">Scala Center</a> and <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lamp/staff">LAMP</a> teams to be present and happy to answer any question you might have regarding their work. This is a free and open event, without any registration needed. Everyone is welcome, including people outside of EPFL. We only ask you to bring your own lunch because we never know how many people would show up nor what they like to eat. :)

    Please note that the Scala Center ensures welcoming and safe spaces on all our events. Both the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/about/overview/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ComplianceGuideEPFL_EN.pdf">EPFL</a> and <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/">Scala Code of Conducts</a> apply. We encourage you to report inappropriate behavior either through EPFL channels or directly to us. Depending on what seems most comfortable to you, use one of the following channels: a) send an email to scala.center@epfl.ch (the Scala Center staff receives it), b) send an email to one member of our staff, or c) anonymously fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVqGPhCd-a3a-AvCPFAqzg0mSPPTE-vNU3yXCNb-5qFunvA/viewform">this form</a>. We take reports seriously and react as quickly as possible to find appropriate solutions. Our entire staff is receiving continuous training in how to handle basic reported cases. For more complex ones, we may either reach out to appropriate EPFL channels or a mediation company that supports us. All cases are treated respectfully and with full confidentiality.
