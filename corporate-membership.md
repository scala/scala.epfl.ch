## Corporate Membership

Corporate members make contributions that are used to fund for-the-good-of-all
initiatives for the Scala community, which includes but is not limited to:
providing scaffolding to help the Scala community develop, publish, find, and
evaluate Scala libraries, improving the landscape of Scala's libraries, and
coordinating and directing the development of libraries/tools of broad benefit
to the community.

### Why join?

Our main focus is to support the Scala developer community. We aim to focus on
initiatives that are for the good of all.

Membership organizations have elected to join for numerous reasons in line with
this vision, including:

- A desire to give back to the Scala community.
- Wanting to pool financial support for initiatives important to the broader Scala community, but are too significant for one organization or individual to contribute alone.
- Desire to participate in discussions about the direction of Scala, its community, and ecosystem.
- A desire to help the Scala Center by serving on committees or the board.

### How do I become a member?
