### Why contribute?

Our main focus is to improve the experience of developing in Scala. This means
that your contribution goes towards:

- Funding developers to develop and mantain libraries and tools of interest to the broader Scala community.
- Covering the costs of community infrastructure and equipment.
- Providing financial assistance to underrepresented groups or students so as to be able to attend major Scala conferences and events.

Organizations or individuals who are interested in but unable to join the Scala
Center as corporate members may also make a contribution totalling 1,500CHF or
more. With this contribution, you will be recognized as a Backer-level donor
alongside of Advisory Board and Affiliate members on the Scala Center homepage.


### Benefits

As an individual member of the Scala Center, you will receive:

- Your name and URL listed as a Supporter-level member of the Scala Center on the Scala Center website
- The results of board meetings and any other substantial Scala Center announcement direct to your inbox
